They're particularly interested in a brain wave called the 'P300 wave'. This wave is like a signal your brain sends when it recognizes a change in the pattern of sounds. It usually occurs around 300 milliseconds after your brain registers the oddball sound. Start the experiment to see how your brain responds!","url":"/experiments/auditory_oddball.html","tags":[],"duration":0}
