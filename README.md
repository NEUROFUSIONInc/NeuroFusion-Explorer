- [exploer_recordings](./explorer_recordings/) A simple scripts you can run locally on your machine to read EEG data from your device if you don't want to use the [NeuroFusion Explorer](https://usefusion.app/playground)


We will continue to update this repo with the latest from our analysis of brain, health & behavior data.
